Manufacturing is a dynamic sector. Improvements in both product and process must continue with the final objective always to gain customer satisfaction. The most common way of improving processes and products is by conducting experiments, the results of which are used as the basis for making improvements.
ANOVA (Analysis  of Variance) is one of the most frequently used experimental methods for various sectors, including the manufacturing sector. ANOVA can be used to analyze the effect of process parameters on the product of the process, one of them is in the grinding process.
In this case, we will analyze one of the grinding process parameters, which is the cutting speed, if it affects the surface roughness of the material.

## Objective

Determine whether the cutting speed value affects the surface roughness of objects resulting from the cylindrical grinding process or not.
